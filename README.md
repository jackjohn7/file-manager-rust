# File Managers in Rust

<img src="/assets/browsing_mode.png">

I'm writing some basic file management tools in Rust to get a feel for
some of the filesystem functions.

The plan is to implement the following:
- GUI with GTK (planned)
- GUI with Tauri (planned)
- TUI with Ratatui (started)

I will be doing the same thing in Go!

# Usage

`git clone https://github.com/jackjohn7/file-manager-rust`

`cd file-manager-rust`

`cargo run --bin tui`
